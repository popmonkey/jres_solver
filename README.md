## Overview

The system consists of two main scripts:

1.  **`solver.py`**: This ingests race and team data from a JSON input to compute an optimal, fair, and balanced schedule. It considers driver availability, stint limits, and rest requirements to create the schedule.
2.  **`formatter.py`**: This takes the schedule generated by the solver and produces user-friendly output in multiple formats, including detailed per-member itineraries in their local timezones.

---
## Stage 1: `solver.py` - The Schedule Optimizer

This script is the core of the scheduling system. It formulates the scheduling problem as a mathematical optimization problem and solves it to find the best possible assignment of drivers and spotters to stints.

### How to Run

Execute the script from the command line. You can provide the JSON input via a file path or pipe it directly to the script using standard input (`stdin`). The distribution includes an example data file at `test_data/24hr.json`.

**Example using a file:**
```bash
python solver.py test_data/24hr.json --output solved_schedule.json --spotter-mode integrated
```

**Example using `stdin`:**
```bash
cat test_data/24hr.json | python solver.py --output solved_schedule.json --spotter-mode integrated
```

**Command-Line Arguments:**

| Argument | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `input_file` | **(Optional)** Path to the JSON input file. If omitted, the script reads from `stdin`. | `None` |
| `--output` | **(Optional)** Path to save the resulting schedule JSON file.  | `None` |
| `--time-limit` | **(Optional)** Maximum time in seconds for the solver to run. | `30` |
| `--spotter-mode`| **(Optional)** The method for scheduling spotters: `none`, `integrated`, or `sequential`. | `none` |
| `--allow-no-spotter`| **(Optional)** Allows stints to have no assigned spotter when a spotter mode is active. | `False` |
| `--optimality-gap`| **(Optional)** A float between 0.0 and 1.0 that tells the solver when a solution is "good enough". | `0.0` |
| `--quiet` | **(Optional)** Suppresses informational log messages during execution. | `False` |

### Understanding Spotter Scheduling Modes

The `--spotter-mode` and `--allow-no-spotter` flags give you fine-grained control over how spotters are assigned to stints.

* **`--spotter-mode none` (Default):**
    * This is the simplest mode. The solver will **only** schedule drivers and will completely ignore the `isSpotter` flag on team members and any spotter-related availability.
    * **When to use:** Use this if you don't need to formally schedule spotters or if you handle spotters outside of this tool.

* **`--spotter-mode sequential`:**
    * This mode performs a two-step calculation:
        1.  First, it solves the entire schedule for **drivers only**, creating the most optimal driver rotation based on their constraints and preferences.
        2.  Then, taking the driver schedule as a fixed constraint, it solves for the most optimal **spotter** rotation in a second pass.
    * **When to use:** This mode prioritizes the driver schedule above all else. It's useful if the driver rotation is the most critical factor and the spotter schedule is secondary. The downside is that it might lead to a less balanced or even infeasible spotter schedule if the driver assignments create difficult constraints.

* **`--spotter-mode integrated`:**
    * This mode solves for both **drivers and spotters simultaneously**. It considers all constraints for both roles at the same time to find a globally optimal schedule for the entire team. A key built-in constraint is that a person cannot drive and spot during the same stint.
    * **When to use:** This is the most comprehensive and balanced approach. Use this when you want the best possible schedule considering the fairness and preferences of both drivers and spotters equally. It may take slightly longer to solve than `sequential` mode but often produces a better overall team schedule.

* **`--allow-no-spotter` (Flag):**
    * This flag can be used with either `sequential` or `integrated` mode.
    * By default, the solver assumes every stint **must** have a spotter assigned. If it cannot find an available spotter for every single stint, the solver will fail.
    * If you add the `--allow-no-spotter` flag, you are telling the solver that it's **acceptable for some stints to have no spotter**. The solver will still try to assign spotters to balance the workload, but it won't fail if it can't find a spotter for every stint.
    * **When to use:** Use this if your team has a limited number of spotters and it's not feasible to cover every single stint of the race, or if you simply don't require 100% spotter coverage.

### Key Scheduling Controls (via JSON Input)

The JSON input provides a comprehensive set of options for configuring the race schedule. While every setting in the `JSON Input Structure` section below plays a role, the following controls have the most significant impact on the solver's output. Understanding these primary controls is key to tailoring the schedule to your team's exact requirements.

#### Global Race Controls
These are top-level settings that affect the entire race schedule.
* **`firstStintDriver`**: You can designate a specific driver to take the very first stint of the race. This is useful for assigning your qualifying driver or a seasoned starter to the opening laps. If this key is omitted, the solver will choose the best driver for the first stint based on other constraints.

#### Per-Member Controls
These settings are defined for each person within the `teamMembers` array and control their individual constraints.
* **`preferredStints`**: For each team member, you can define the maximum number of consecutive stints they are willing to do. This prevents driver fatigue and ensures variety.
* **`minimumRestHours`**: You can enforce a mandatory, uninterrupted rest period for any team member. The solver will ensure that it finds a block of time in the schedule where the member has no duties for at least this many hours.

#### Team Availability Control (`availability` object)
This is the most powerful control for managing your team's schedule in detail.
* **Structure**: The `availability` object contains keys that match the `name` of a team member. The value for each member is another object where keys are **hourly UTC timestamps** that mark the beginning of an hour (e.g., `1973-06-09T14:00:00.000Z`).
* **Hourly Blocks**: The solver checks a stint's start time against these hourly blocks. For accurate scheduling, you should define availability for every hour of the race for any member who is not available for the entire event.
* **Status Values**:
    * **`Unavailable`**: The solver is **strictly forbidden** from assigning any duty (driving or spotting) to the member if a stint starts within this hour.
    * **`Preferred`**: The solver is **heavily incentivized** to assign a duty to the member during this hour. This is a great way to accommodate members who want to drive/spot at a specific time.
    * **`Available` (Default)**: If an hour is not specified for a member, they are considered available. There is no need to explicitly set a status of `"Available"`.

### JSON Input Structure

The solver requires a JSON input with a specific structure to function correctly.

One good source of this input is the associated [JRES Availability Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jI2mtS0R8dtT7gnAtxIkMfLRcRnqWuXaFc0xvM96Smw/copy).

## Troubleshooting

If `solver.py` fails to find an optimal solution, it's typically for one of two reasons: the solver ran out of time, or the problem is impossible to solve with the given constraints.

### Solver Timeout
By default, the solver is given **30 seconds** to find a solution. For complex schedules with many drivers and constraints, this may not be enough time. The time required also depends heavily on the speed of your computer—a modern M2 MacBook will solve much faster than a Raspberry Pi.

* **Solution:** Increase the timeout using the `--time-limit` argument.
    ```bash
    python solver.py test_data/24hr.json --time-limit 120
    ```

### Overly Constrained Problem
If increasing the timeout doesn't help, it's likely that your parameters have created a problem with no possible solution. The more restrictive your constraints, the harder the problem is to solve.

Here are the factors most likely to make a solution difficult or impossible, from most to least impactful:

1.  **`minimumRestHours`**: This is a very strong constraint. Requesting long, mandatory rest periods for multiple team members severely limits scheduling flexibility.
2.  **`availability`**: Having too many team members marked as `Unavailable` for overlapping periods can make it impossible to cover all the stints.
3.  **Small Team Size**: The fewer people available to drive or spot, the fewer options the solver has.
4.  **`integrated` Spotter Mode**: Requiring a driver *and* a spotter for every single stint is much more restrictive than only scheduling drivers.
5.  **Low `preferredStints` Values**: If all team members can only do one stint at a time, it can conflict with mandatory rest periods.

**How to Relax Constraints:**
If you suspect the problem is too constrained, try relaxing the parameters in this order:
* First, try adding the `--allow-no-spotter` flag if you are using `integrated` or `sequential` spotter mode.
* Reduce the `minimumRestHours` value for one or more team members.
* Review the `availability` object. Can any `Unavailable` block be removed?
* Increase the `preferredStints` value for one or more team members.

### Finding a 'Good Enough' Solution (`--optimality-gap`)
Sometimes the solver uses the full time limit not because a solution is hard to find, but because there are *many* good solutions, and it's spending a lot of time making tiny, insignificant improvements to find the absolute "best" one.

The `--optimality-gap` argument lets you tell the solver to stop as soon as it finds a solution that is "good enough." The value is a float from 0.0 to 1.0, representing a percentage. For example, a value of `0.1` means the solver can stop once it finds a solution that is guaranteed to be within 10% of the theoretical best possible score.

* **When to use:** This is extremely useful if the solver is hitting the time limit. It can dramatically cut down on runtime while still providing an excellent, well-balanced schedule.
* **Solution:** Start by trying a gap of 10% or 20%.
    ```bash
    # Stop when a solution within 10% of optimal is found
    python solver.py test_data/24hr.json --optimality-gap 0.1

    # Stop when a solution within 20% of optimal is found
    python solver.py test_data/24hr.json --optimality-gap 0.2
    ```

## How It Works

This tool leverages the power of mathematical optimization to solve the complex problem of race scheduling.

The core of `solver.py` is the **`pulp`** library, a popular open-source package for modeling and solving linear programming (LP) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems in Python.

Here's a high-level overview of the process:
1.  **Model Formulation**: The script reads the JSON input and translates the race parameters, team member roles, and constraints (like availability, rest times, and consecutive stint limits) into a mathematical model.
2.  **Decision Variables**: It creates binary decision variables for each possible assignment (e.g., "should Driver A take Stint 5?").
3.  **Objective Function**: The script defines a primary goal, which is to create the most "fair" schedule possible. It does this by minimizing the difference in the number of stints between team members and also minimizing the number of driver/spotter changes to reduce disruption.
4.  **Solving**: The `pulp` library takes this model and uses an underlying solver (like CBC, which is included with `pulp`) to find the optimal set of "yes" or "no" answers for all the decision variables that satisfies all constraints and best achieves the objective function.
5.  **Output**: The final, optimal assignments are formatted into the `solved_schedule.json` file, which is then used by `formatter.py` to generate the human-readable output.
